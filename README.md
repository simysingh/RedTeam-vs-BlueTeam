# RedTeam-vs-BlueTeam
Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which you play the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.


As the Red Team, you attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, you use Kibana to review logs taken during the PenTesting Engagement. You'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for a report.

Applied knowledge of the following skills and tools:
 - Penetration testing with Kali Linux.
 - Log and incident analysis with Kibana.
 - System hardening and configuration.
 - Reporting, documentation, and communication.

Security+ Domains:
 - Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities
 - Architecture and Design
 - Implementation
 - Operations and Incident Response

PenTesting:
  Red Team - A red team imitates real-world attacks that can hit a company or an organization, and they perform all the necessary steps that attackers would use. By assuming the role of an attacker, they show organizations what could be backdoors or exploitable vulnerabilities that pose a threat to their cybersecurity.

      Vulnerability Scan:
              A vulnerability scanner is an application that identifies and creates an inventory of all the systems (including servers, desktops,                                     laptops, virtual machines, containers, firewalls, switches, and printers) connected to a network. For each device that it identifies it                                 also attempts to identify the operating system it runs and the software installed on it, along with other attributes such as open ports and                             user accounts.
       Reverse Shell:
              In a typical remote system access scenario, the user is the client and the target machine is the server. The user initiates a remote shell connection and               the target system listens for such connections. With a reverse shell, the roles are opposite. It is the target machine that initiates the connection to                 the user, and the userâ€™s computer listens for incoming connections on a specified port.



  
  Blue Team - A blue team is similar to a red team in that it also assesses network security and identifies any possible vulnerabilities.
      Some of the steps a blue team incorporates are:
        -Security audits, such as a DNS audit
        -Log and memory analysis
        -pcap
        -Risk intelligence data analysis
        -Digital footprint analysis
        -Reverse engineering
        -DDoS testing
        -Developing risk scenarios
      
        Kibana Discover: 
             When you know what your data includes, you can create visualizations that best display that data and build better dashboards. Discover enables you to                  explore your data, find hidden insights and relationships, and get answers to your questions. 
             With Discover you can:
                  - Access every document in every index that matches your selected index pattern
                  - Search your data and filter the search results
                  - Get field-level details about the documents that match your search
                  - View the events that occurred just before and after a document
                  
        Kibana Visualizations: 
              Visualize enables you to create visualizations of the data from your Elasticsearch indices, which you can then add to dashboards for analysis.
              Kibana visualizations are based on Elasticsearch queries. By using a series of Elasticsearch aggregations to extract and process your data, you can                     create charts that show you the trends, spikes, and dips you need to know about.
